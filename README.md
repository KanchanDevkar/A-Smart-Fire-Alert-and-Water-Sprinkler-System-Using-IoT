# About
Fire Detection is an important issue in today’s world because it directly threatens the life of living organisms, especially human life, which must be dealt on time without any unnecessary delay to avoid the losses. Researches dealing with fire detection have always been important since the spread and the impact of fire detection in residential areas, business centers, industrial areas and open areas is critical. When the temperature exceeds 50 degree Celsius it is considered as fire situation. The Fire services are not well organized in India. In recent years, the requirements for fire safety cover have increased manifold whereas the development of Fire Service has not made much headway. The setting up of Industrial Plants at a fast pace with extensive use of hazardous materials and the construction of larger and taller buildings have multiplied the problems regarding fire incidents.  

The systems which are available in market for fire detection in buildings are causing difficulties in quick alerting, taking action regarding the fire situation and in sending notifications to the owner in case nobody is present near the incident area. In this case we can make use of the newest technologies to overcome the issues occurred in the systems that are currently in use. The proposed system is intended to create a system that will overcome the faults in the existing systems and prevent human lives and properties from getting highly damaged.

# Project
The threat to people’s lives and property caused by fires has become increasingly serious. Due to this the property management has been one of the principal worries for builders, architects, and property owners. To address the problem of high false alarm rate and to resolve the issue of not taking quick action in traditional fire detection, we are introducing an innovative detection method using IoT. Solitary sensors were utilized for quite a while in case of identification of fire. However, these sensors cannot take measures of fire to alarm the crisis reaction units. To resolve this issue, there is a need to develop a system using a smart fire recognition framework, that would recognize the fire utilizing coordinated sensors to send alerts to property owners, crisis administration and neighbors also, take quick action as soon as fire is detected. The proposed model utilizes diverse incorporated locators, like warmth, smoke, and fire. The signals from those identifiers go through the framework calculation to check the probability of the fire and automatically starts water irrigation. The most important feature of the proposed framework is to limit faulty alerts as well as start water sprinkler irrigation system when fire gets detected, which make this framework more steady. The tentative result showed the prevalence of our model as far as moderateness, viability, and responsiveness as the framework utilizes the blynk app stage, which makes the information trade quicker and stable.
